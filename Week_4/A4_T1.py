#Create a Python program which prompts user to insert two integers. Use these integers together with the “for-loop” structure to create behaviour like in the example program example run below.

#Note! the autograding tool will test that the correct structure has been applied.

#Example program runs

#Program starting.

#Insert starting value: 11
#Insert stopping value: 13

#Starting for-loop:
#11
#12
#13

#Program ending.
