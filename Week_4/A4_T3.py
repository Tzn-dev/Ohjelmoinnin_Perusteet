#Make Python program which prompts user to insert two integers. Use these integers together with the “while-loop” structure to create behaviour like in the example program run below.

#Note! the autograding tool will test that the correct structure has been applied.

#Example program runs

#Program starting.

#Insert starting value: 1
#Insert stopping value: 10

#Starting while-loop:
#1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

#Program ending.
