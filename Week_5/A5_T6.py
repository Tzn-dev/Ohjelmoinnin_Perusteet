#    Make a menu-driven Python program which mimics Tally Counter.
#
#    This menu-driven program must contain a maintainable program structure with the following requirements:
#
#        main function which represents the main program logic including menu cycle.
#        showOptions function which takes no arguments, shows the available options in the standard output and returns None.
#        askChoice function which takes no arguments, prompts user to insert choice and returns an integer regardless of the user feed.
#
#    In case user incorrectly inserts text as a choice, the program must output "Unknown option!". For this, see the string method isnumeric() behaviour described in W3S or via Python documentation.
#
#    See other requirements in the example program runs below.
