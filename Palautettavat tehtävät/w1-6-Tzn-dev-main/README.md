# W1_6

Create a Python program that is able to calculate remainder. Remainder can be calculated using modulo “%” operator. See also “modulus” example in W3Schools.

* Prompt user “Insert an integer: ” and assign the input value into Feed variable
* Convert the Feed into an integer and assign it to Value variable
* Calculate the remainder of the Value when divided by 2 and assign it to the Remainder variable.
* Print the inserted value “Value is {Value}”
* Print the remainder value “The remainder is {Remainder} when {Value} is divided by 2.”

Example program run:
````
Insert an integer: 479
Value is 479
The remainder is 1 when 479 is divided by 2.
````
