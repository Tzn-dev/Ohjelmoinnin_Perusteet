# W1_5

Make a Python program which can take user inputs and convert them into integers.

* Print “Calculate the area of a wall.”
* Prompt user
  * “Enter the width in meters: ”
  * Store the input value into Feed variable.
* Convert the Feed variable into an integer and store it in Width variable
* Prompt user
  * “Enter the height in meters: ”
  * Store the input value into Feed variable.
* Convert the Feed variable into an integer and store it in Height variable
* Print “Width is {Width} m and height is {Height} m.”
* Multiply Width and Height, then store the result in Area variable
* Display results to the user: “The wall will be {Area} square meters.”
* Try the program with different inputs e.g. decimals. Notice any problems in the program? Are you able to solve the issue?

Example program run:
````
Calculate the area of a wall.
Enter the width in meters: 2
Enter the height in meters: 3
Width is 2 m and height is 3 m.
The wall will be 6 square meters.
````
